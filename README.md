## Overview
This Python program calculates the average of three test scores provided by the user and determines if the average qualifies as a high score. It provides feedback to the user about their performance.

## Features
- Accepts three test scores as input from the user
- Calculates the average of the three scores
- Displays the average score with one decimal place
- Congratulates the user if their average exceeds the defined high score threshold

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Run the program
2. Enter three test scores when prompted
3. View your average score
4. Receive congratulations if your average exceeds the high score threshold

## Constants
- `HIGH_SCORE`: Set to 95, defines the threshold for a high score

## Input
The program prompts for three integer values:
- Test 1 score
- Test 2 score
- Test 3 score

## Output
- Displays the average score formatted to one decimal place
- If the average exceeds 95, displays a congratulatory message

## Example
Enter your score for test 1: 98
Enter your score for test 2: 95
Enter your score for test 3: 97

Your average score is 96.7

Congratulations! on achieving a high score


## Code Structure
1. Defines `HIGH_SCORE` constant
2. Collects three test scores from user input
3. Calculates the average
4. Displays the average
5. Checks if average exceeds `HIGH_SCORE` and provides feedback

## Notes
- Input values should be integers
- The program assumes valid numeric input
- The high score threshold can be modified by changing the `HIGH_SCORE` constant
